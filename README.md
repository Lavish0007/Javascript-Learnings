  # *Number Guessing Game* 

This is a simple console-based number guessing game developed in JavaScript. The program randomly generates a number within a defined range, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the program gives hints whether the guessed number is too high or too low. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number. It demonstrates the use of basic JavaScript concepts like loops, conditionals, user input via prompt(), and random number generation.
